README:

ATMDemo is a small web app that uses Spring Boot:
- maven Project
- spring Boot version 2.2.12
- java 8
- packaging: Jar (Tomcat embedded)
- dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security,
                H2 Database (in memory DB), Thymeleaf (for web pages)

The app has 4 endpoints:

- "/loginPage" for the Spring security login
  At startUp the User table from the DB will be populated with following users (use them to login):
        * username= "Billy" , password/PIN= "1111" (in DB is encoded), amount= "20000"
        * username= "Bobby" , password/PIN= "2222" (in DB is encoded), amount= "15000"
        * username= "Johnny" , password/PIN= "3333" (in DB is encoded), amount= "10000"

- "/access-denied" I didn't use roles because the app was getting too complicated, but I used this page for testing purposes

- "/" This is the accountPage that shows the user account details after successful login

- "/h2-console" this is an client DB app for the H2 DB. I opened access (.antMatchers("/h2-console/**").hasAnyRole())
   for tests purposes, but normally this endpoint should be restricted.
   Authentication details: (needs login from Spring security)
        Driver Class: org.h2.Driver
        JDBC URL: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
        User Name: sa
        Password: (no password)


As a Java 8 new feature I've used a functional interface (CommandlineRunner to populate the DB at startup)
I've created an integration test where I inserted an User in the DB and afterwards I read the new row from the DB
and compared it to the object I've inserted.
